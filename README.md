# Recommendation
IDEs:
* PyCharm

# Installing
Clone to your current repository in cmd:  
If you already have the code skip this step!  
`git clone https://github.com/kodyVS/Discord-Bot-Development`

Then make sure to install the python's REQUIREMENTS.txt also through some cmd  
`pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  

inside the `src` folder create a file called `DISCORD_TOKEN.txt`  

go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications/  
and create an application (app).  
Then create a Bot in it.  
Copy the Bot's TOKEN to your clipboard with the nice `Copy` button

Then copy this TOKEN inside the `DISCORD_TOKEN.txt` file.

**You *should* be all set**

# How to add my code now?

* create a new branch for your feature/issue with `git checkout -b <[feature-name]-new-branch-name>` 
* check your current branch with `git branch`
* go to the newly created branch if necessary with `git checkout <new-or-existing-branch-name>`
* Write/Add your code!
* `git add .` and `git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"`


##### REALLY IMPORTANT: **`git pull origin master` into your own branch, to fix any conflicts before you push to the remote (to GitHub)**


* Then `git commit` any of the conflicts you fixed, if you had them
*  then `git push origin <your-branch-name>`
*  Go to the Github page (in your browser) and see the comment that says: "you recently .... do you want to create a PR?"
*  Select to merge into the master-branch, write what you changed/made in the message, etc.
*  Create the PR.
